<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received the B.S. degree in Communication Engineering from Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China, in 2020, and have received the Ph.D. degree at the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2025. Since July 2025, I have joined the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong Universty of Science and Technology.

My research interest includes Beyond Massive MIMO for future 6G wireless communications, involving:

- Electromagnetic Information Theory: Channel Modeling, Spatial Non-Uniform Sampling
- Statistical Signal Processing: Compressive Sensing, Channel Estimation, MIMO Detection
- Resource Optimization: Matrix Analysis, Convex Optimization
- Artifical Intelligence: Generative AI for Statistical Signal Processing

Up to now, I have published more than 10 papers in several flagship IEEE journals and EI conferences (including IEEE TSP, IEEE TCOM, IEEE TVT, IEEE CL, IEEE VTC, IEEE WCSP, IEEE WCNC etc.) in the field of Beyond Massive MIMO.
