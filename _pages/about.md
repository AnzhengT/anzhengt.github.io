I received the B.S. degree in Communication Engineering from Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China, in 2020. Since 2022, I have been pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China. My research interest includes Beyond Massive MIMO for future 6G wireless communications, involving:

- Electromegnatic Information Theory: Channel Modeling, Spatial Non-Uniform Sampling
- Statistical Signal Processing: Compressive Sensing, Channel Estimation, MIMO Detection
- Resource Optimization: Matrix Analysis, Convex Optimization

Up to now, I have published more than 10 papers in several flagship IEEE journals and EI conferences (including IEEE TSP, IEEE TCOM, IEEE TVT, IEEE CL, IEEE VTC, IEEE WCSP, etc.) in the field of Beyond Massive MIMO.
